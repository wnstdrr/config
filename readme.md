# Configs

My personal configs for: 

    * terminal 
    * editor 
    * xorg/x11
    * other dot files

# Debian Only

auto config installer run
```bash
chmod +x update.sh && ./update.sh
```
> Note: Installer only works on Debian

# Void Linux

Most of the packages in this repo are geared towards the minimal installation of Void Linux.
Will be working on a better void-installer package to make this process super fast and easy.
